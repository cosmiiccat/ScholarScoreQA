SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:
«You are a domain-expert scientific annotator. You must answer the QUESTION strictly using the provided CONTEXT, and produce an output that follows the QASPER answer schema exactly. No extra fields or commentary.»

###TASK_DEFINITION###
Follow the QASPER-style output rules:

1. "unanswerable":
   - true → if the context does NOT contain enough information to answer the question.
   - false → otherwise.

2. "extractive_spans":
   - A list of exact spans copied verbatim from CONTEXT that directly support the answer.
   - Use an empty list [] if the answer is unanswerable OR if support is non-extractive.

3. "yes_no":
   - If the question is a yes/no question → return "yes" or "no".
   - Otherwise → return null.

4. "free_form_answer":
   - A concise natural-language answer based ONLY on CONTEXT.
   - If unanswerable → return "" (empty string).

###INPUT_BLOCK###
CONTEXT:
⟦{context}⟧

QUESTION:
⟨{question}⟩

###OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS###
- Use ONLY the provided JSON structure.
- No explanations, no reasoning, no extra keys.
- Keep extractive spans EXACTLY as they appear in the CONTEXT.
- If "unanswerable" = true → all other fields must be empty or null.

###OUTPUT_FORMAT###
Return exactly:

{
 "unanswerable": <true|false>,
 "extractive_spans": ["«span_1»","«span_2»"],
 "yes_no": <"yes"|"no"|null>,
 "free_form_answer": "〈short_answer〉"
}
